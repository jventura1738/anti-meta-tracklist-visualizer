# ANTI META Tracklist Visualizer

"ANTI META" by Zoom coming to all platforms soon | This is what I used to create the teasers from instagram

![sample]((https://github.com/jventura1738/anti-meta-tracklist-visualizer/blob/master/sample_run.gif))

## If you wanna try it:

1. Make sure you're using zsh, otherwise you can modify the subprocess command for bash
2. Use `ANTIMETA_TERMINAL` Mac terminal config for desired color effects.
3. `python3 decode_tracklist.py` to run.
4. You can modify the code to do other cool stuff if you want!

###### NOTE: I made this in like 30mins and didn't necessarily make it work for Windows. If something goes wrong above, you might need to tweak the subprocess/os.system commands such as clear -> cls. I just posted this to access this on another machine so forgive me if it doesn't work for non-Mac.
